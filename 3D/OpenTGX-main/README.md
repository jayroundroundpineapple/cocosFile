## About `OpenTGX`

![open-tgx-logo-txt.png](./open-tgx-logo-txt.png)

`OpenTGX` is a free and open-source game development solution using typescript for both client and server sides.

The biggest difference compared to the other frameworks is that `OpenGTX` is not only a framework, it is based on a unified basic framework and has plenty of examples and cases to meet the project's requirements and solve problems.

- `Open` = open source and open-minded
- `T` = TypeScript, both client and server are written by TS
- `G` = based on Game Development Technique
- `X` = plenty of various examples and cases for different fields.

> Open is the attitude, T is the interacting interface, G is the technical basis, and X is the plan and objective.

`OpenTGX` is based on [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/creator) (one of the top game engines in the world) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)( the most popular JS server-side programming platform).

It targets to be a solution that can solve the daily development requirements and issues.

The client and server sides can be used separately, you can use only one of them for your needs.

The **Get Started** will come soon.

## Why Do You Need It?

After communicating with thousands of developers, I found many strong needs as below.

1. **Skill Improvement**: Learn more tricks and get more practical experience
2. **Well-organized Project Templates**: Speed up project development.
3. **High-Quality Framework**: Useful Solutions to solve plenty of basic requirements and problems.

So I wrote and open-source the `OpenTGX` project.

Most of the content is based on my 15y+ experience in game development. It's not perfect but can solve many problems to speed up your development progress and make your project management easier when working together with many team members.

More and more components will be added in the future, such as networking, 2d games components, 3d games components, etc.

From this, Mr Kylin(me) will work together with other developers based on `OpenTGX` to give you more projects, examples, and tutorials which we think can help you a lot.

I hope more and more developers join us to make `OpenTGX` better.
